# OP-Yield in R Shiny

This application is a translation of the OP-Yield Microsoft Excel™ spreadsheet v1.00.4 (Ritchie and Zhang 2018) to `R` & `RStudio`'s `Shiny` interactive web application. The application produces growth and yield prediction for ponderosa pine (*Pinus ponderosa* Lawson & C. Lawson) plantations in northern California. Inspired by Oliver and Powers' original work (1978), several features were fixed and added. For further theoretical background and technical detail, please refer to the documentation written by M.W. Ritchie and J. Zhang (2018) from US Forest Service. It is available at [https://www.fs.fed.us/psw/publications/documents/psw_gtr259/](https://www.fs.fed.us/psw/publications/documents/psw_gtr259/).

## Description

Using 14 user-specified values (from the ''Input Values'' tab), the application produced yield summary, growing stock, and precommercial thinning summary tables. In addition, annual volume increment, stand density, density distribution by crown class plots can be generated. Users can download tables and figures into their devices with various file formats (e.g., csv, xlsx for tables and pdf, png, and tiff for figures).
